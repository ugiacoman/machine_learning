# K-Means Clustering

## Description
Matlab script testing clustering on set of images. 

## Summary Report

The following report talks through a few points and results found through experimentation with the script.

### Test Design

When testing an image, we tested both a large version and a small version. Then, we compared the results with an image with similar features, but highler complexity. For example, we took a picture of a buffalo and compared the results to that of a picture with multiple buffullo. This design would allows us to come up with a base case and compare across complexity.

### Computational Costs
	
#### Size of Image

#### Number of Clusters

### Different Solutions for Repeated k-means Runs

### Trade-Off Between Clusters and Quality of Image

### Complexity of Image
